The Department of Energy (DOE), introduced the __Grid-Interactive Efficient Building (GEB)__ Initiative to promote the integration of distributed energy resources (DERS) such as photovoltaic (PV) systems, electric vehicles (EVs), active and passive storage systems e.g. batteries, thermal storage tanks and thermal mass (walls) in buildings that can provide the grid with energy flexibility. A GEB is defined by [Neukomm et al., 2019](https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/pdfs/75470.pdf)] as:\n","\n","> [...] an energy-efficient building that uses smart technologies and on-site DERs to provide demand flexibility while co-optimizing for energy cost, grid services, and occupant needs and preferences, in a continuous and integrated way.\n","\n","GEBs are characterized by their energy efficiency, interconnectivity, smartness and energy flexibility as highlighted in the figure below:\n","\n","<figure class=\"image\">\n","  <img src=\"https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/CityLearn/blob/master/assets/images/grid_interactive_building-neukomm.png?raw=true\"  width=\"600\" alt=\"The characteristics of a Grid-Interactive Efficient Building (GEB)\">\n","  <figcaption>Figure: The characteristics of a Grid-Interactive Efficient Building (GEB) (<a href=\"https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/pdfs/75470.pdf\">Neukomm et al., 2019</a>).</figcaption>\n","</figure>\n","\n","The energy efficiency of GEBs by means of tighter envelopes and high-quality construction that minimize heat losses lead to reduced loads without the need to make changes to a building's function or for changes in occupant preferences. PV adoption in GEBs provides self-generation capabilities which reduce the net load (difference between building end-use load and renewable energy generation) that will otherwise be satisfied by the electric grid alone. To then solve the duck curve problem that is introduced by renewable power generation, GEBs are able to shed and/or shift their loads. In load shedding, GEBs reduce their electricity use for a short time period and typically on short notice during peak demand periods. Load shifting in GEBs entails intentional and planned change in the timing of electricity use to reduce the demand on the grid during typical peak periods. Load shifting helps take advantage of cheaper and cleaner electricity. Load shedding  an result in shifting the shedded load.\n","\n","The figure below shows the changes in a building profile as it becomes more efficient, incorporates self generation and provides load shedding and shifting grid services.\n","\n","<figure class=\"image\">\n","  <img src=\"https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/CityLearn/blob/master/assets/images/grid_interactive_building_profile-neukomm.png?raw=true\"  width=\"600\" alt=\"GEB load profiles\">\n","  <figcaption>Figure: GEB load profiles (<a href=\"https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/pdfs/75470.pdf\">Neukomm et al., 2019</a>).</figcaption>\n","</figure>\n","\n","Particularly, load shifting services could be achieved through control of active storage systems in combination with renewable power generation. Smart controls can adapt to changes in occupant behavior, weather conditions or respond to external signals e.g. temperature set-point as in the case of demand-response, while maintaining energy efficiency and without causing discomfort to occupants. This adaptability is often referred to as __energy flexibility__ of a building ([Jensen et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.08.044))."],"metadata":{"id":"3RN4VIYf0_Zs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Control Theories for Grid-Interactive Efficient Buildings\n","Rule-based control (RBC) is a popular control theory for building energy management. It makes use of simple if-else statements in their decision making process e.g. \"if outdoor dry-bulb temperature is < 20<sup>o</sup>C and hour is 10 PM, charge battery by 5% of its capacity\". Advanced control systems such as model predictive control (MPC) ([Drgona et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcontrol.2020.09.001)) and reinforcement learning control (RLC) ([Wang et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115036)) can be a major driver for executing grid services by automating the operation of energy systems, while adapting to individual characteristics of occupants and buildings. Comparatively, RBC and RLC are inexpensive to implement as they have a lower entry bar for domain knowledge of the systems to be controlled. RBC and vanilla RLC may perform sub-optimally compared to MPC as they are not modeled after the system under control although there exists a branch of RLC that includes a model of the controlled system. However, RLC is a data-driven solution and as more training data become available, it _learns_ the model of the building or system under control and achieves comparable performance as MPC. The greatest strength of RLC is its ability to adapt to changes in the system or building it controls as the dynamics e.g. thermal, occupancy change.

In supervised learning, the observations, otherwise called samples, and their response, otherwise called target are known when training the model. Supervised learning is further classified into regression and classification models where the former learns to predict a continuous variable and the latter learns to predict a discrete class. The supervised machine learning model must then learn the mapping of samples and targets by minimizing a loss function that evaluates the error between predicted targets and actual targets. An example of regression modelling in the context of GEBs is the prediction of a building's electricity consumption (target) when the the weather conditions e.g. dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity, as well as their associated timestamps (samples) are known. An example of a classification model in the context of GEBs is the prediction of a binary variable such as if building is \"occupied\" or \"not occupied\" (target) given the same samples as the regression example. It so happens that these kinds of problems are common in the building energy domain where predicting a building's electricity consumption and occupancy can help with scheduling and occupant-centric control to balance energy efficiency and comfort.\n","\n","Unsupervised learning on the other hand differs from supervised learning in the sense that the associated targets for the samples are unknown but models can be used to find common patterns amongst samples. This is important especially in exploratory data analysis to draw preliminary conclusions about a new dataset, and in situations where the class labels are unknown. An unsupervised model can then be used to infer data-driven class labels that can be used as targets in supervised classification models. An example of such application in buildings is the classification of customer load profiles to determine and allocate appropriate tariff plans.\n","\n","RL is similar to both supervised and unsupervised learning such that it follows the same idea of learning from observations. However in contrast to supervised learning, there are no known labeled targets. Instead, a model (agent/controller) influences the targets by acting in an environment that rewards actions that have desirable outcomes but penalizes those that lead to adverse outcomes. An example of RL in GEBs is charging/discharging of a battery (action) every hour (control time step) with the objective of minimizing the sum of electricity consumption of a building over a control horizon e.g. a year, given the same sample variables in the supervised learning example (observations). These actions affect the hourly electricity consumption of the building (reward). RL is thought of as a trial an error approach because typically, the agent starts off with no prior knowledge of the environment it acts in but learns from experience to associate observations with actions that maximize its rewards. The association is called a control policy.\n","\n","<figure class=\"image\">\n","  <img src=\"https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/CityLearn/blob/master/assets/images/reinforcement_learning.png?raw=true\"  width=\"400\" alt=\"Basic structure of reinforcement learning.\">\n","  <figcaption>Figure: Basic structure of reinforcement learning (<a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315142074-37/reinforcement-learning-intelligent-environments-zoltan-nagy-june-young-park-josé-ramón-vázquez-canteli\">Nagy et al., 2018</a>).</figcaption>\n","</figure>\n","\n","The experiential learning characteristic of RL is very promising for GEBs because it provides a scalable control solution as it can adapt to each building's unique conditions and occupant interactions that influence observations.

Tabular Q-Learning and SAC are both reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms where the difference between the two is that while in Tabular Q-Learning, Q-values are updated through exhaustive exploration and exploitation of the environment, SAC uses a function approximator to estimate the Q-values to accelerate learning. More information about Tabular Q-Learning, Q-values and SAC will be provided in the following sections so do no worry if they are not familiar terms _yet_ 🙂.\n","\n","By using these three control algorithms, we will highlight some of their strengths and weaknesses.

Since CityLearn is primarily designed for district level energy management and coordination we should use more than 1 building, although a 1-building environment is possible. An considerable building count for tutoring purposes is 2-3.\n","2.

Instead of using the [full observation space](https://www.citylearn.net/overview/observations.html) that will take a while to explore and converge in RL implementations, we will narrow down the space to only one observations: `hour`. This is not the best set up because the hour alone does not explain the state transitions in the environment that the agent is observing, nevertheless, it will help highlight the strengths and weaknesses of different control algorithms.\n","4. CityLearn allows for two control strategies: centralized and decentralized as earlier discussed. In this tutorial we will make use of the former.\n","\n","We will make these modifications directly in the schema. To keep things interesting, the buildings and one-week period will be pseudo-randomly selected but for reproducibility, we will set the random generator seed. This seed can be changed to any value to select another pseudorandom set of buildings and time period. Also, we will provide a method to set the observations we want to use in our simulations so that later down the line, it will be easy to switch and utilize other observations.

RBC is a popular control strategy that is used in most systems e.g. HVAC, batteries, etc because of their level of simplicity. They are  best described as a set of rules expressed as if-else statements and conditions that guide their decision making. An example of such statement is `if outdoor dry-bulb temperature is 20 degrees Celcius and hour 10 PM, charge battery with 5% of capacity`. Now the actual implementation of this statement is open-ended as a designer can choose to program it using any programming language e.g. Python (as used in CityLearn) or a proprietary language that the battery manufacturer uses. Nevertheless, at a high-level, it simplifies to a set of statements and conditions that are easily understood and mappable (think decision tree in supervised learning).\n","\n","The RBC you will be designing here, is a set of if-else statements that use the `hour` observation to determine the amount of energy to charge or discharge a battery.

Inheritance, allows us to copy existing properties and methods in the parent class, `HourRBC`, into our custom class.

Likewise, we want to reduce the peaks and ramping, and increase the load factor. One way to achieve this is to teach the agent to charge the batteries when electricity is cheap after 9 PM and before 4 PM, which typically coincides with when the grid is cleaner (lower emissions). But recall that each building is able to generate power provided there is solar radiation. So, we can take advantage of self-generation in the late morning to late afternoon to charge for free and discharge the rest of the day thus reducing electricity consumption, cost and emissions at the very least. Also, by shifting the early morning and evening peak loads to the batteries we can improve on our peak and load-factor KPIs.\n","\n","We should also teach our agent to ensure that renewable solar generation is not wasted by making use of the PV to charge the batteries while they are charged below capacity. On the flip side, the agent should learn to discharge when there is net positive grid load and the batteries still have stored energy.\n","\n","Given these learning objectives, we can now define a reward function that closely satisfies the criteria for which the agent will learn good rewards:\n","\n","$$\n","    r = \\sum_{i=0}^n \\Big(p_i \\times |C_i|\\Big)\n","$$\n","\n","$$\n","    p_i = -\\left(1 + \\textrm{sign}(C_i) \\times \\textrm{SOC}^{\\textrm{battery}}_i\\right)\n","$$\n","\n","The reward function, $r$, is designed to minimize electricity cost, $C$.

There is neither penalty nor reward when the battery is fully charged during net export to the grid.
