Electrification of end-uses as well as decarbonizing the electrical grid through renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, constitutes a pathway to zero-emission buildings ([Leibowicz et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.046)). However, electrifying fossil-fueled building end-uses in fact could increase the demand on the existing electricity power grid and if power generation sources are not decarbonized at a similar rate as electrification happening on the demand side, could result in adverse effects of increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Also, new grid infrastructure constitutes a significant capital investment and requires extensive planning and execution.\n",

On-site solar photovoltaic (PV) systems can also reduce dependence on the grid through self-generation. Yet, the intermittency of renewable energy sources introduces additional challenges of grid instability due to the mismatch between electricity generation (supply) and demand ([Suberu et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2014.04.009)). The California duck-curve is a good illustration of the mismatch in renewable supply and demand, and shows the effect of increased PV penetration that may lead to higher ramp rate during sunset which the electric power grid may not be able to handle ([Denholm et al., 2008](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/42305.pdf)).\n",

        "\n",
        "As buildings become electrified and the penetration of renewable energy source increases, a smart approach to managing and controlling building loads to ensure that these developments do not bring about grid insecurity is needed. The Department of Energy (DOE), introduced the __Grid-Interactive Efficient Building (GEB)__ Initiative to promote the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as photovoltaic (PV) systems, electric vehicles (EVs), active energy storage systems e.g. batteries, thermal energy storage systems, and passive energy storage systems e.g. thermal mass (walls) in buildings that can provide the grid with energy flexibility. A GEB is defined by [Neukomm et al.](https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/pdfs/75470.pdf) as:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The energy efficiency of GEBs by means of tighter envelopes and high-quality construction that minimize heat losses lead to reduced loads without the need to make changes to a building's function or occupant preferences. PV adoption in GEBs provides self-generation capabilities, which reduce the net load (difference between building end-use load and renewable energy generation) that will otherwise be satisfied by the electric grid alone. To then solve the duck curve problem that is introduced by renewable power generation, GEBs are able to shed and/or shift their loads. In load shedding, GEBs reduce their electricity use for a short time period and typically on short notice during peak demand periods. Load shifting in GEBs entails intentional and planned change in the timing of electricity use to reduce the demand on the grid during typical peak periods. Load shifting helps take advantage of cheaper and cleaner electricity. Load shedding may result in shifting the shedded load.\n",

        "Particularly, load shifting services could be achieved through control of active storage systems in combination with renewable power generation. Smart controls can adapt to changes in occupant behavior, weather conditions or respond to external signals e.g. temperature set-point as in the case of demand-response, while maintaining energy efficiency and without causing discomfort to occupants. This adaptability is often referred to as __energy flexibility__ of a building ([Jensen et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.08.044))."

        "## Control Approaches for Grid-Interactive Efficient Buildings\n",
        "Rule-based control (RBC) is a popular control approach for building energy management. It makes use of simple if-else statements in their decision making process e.g. \"if outdoor dry-bulb temperature is < 20<sup>o</sup>C and hour is 10 PM, charge battery by 5% of its capacity\". Advanced control systems such as model predictive control (MPC) ([Drgona et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcontrol.2020.09.001)) and reinforcement learning control (RLC) ([Wang et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115036)) can be a major driver for executing grid services by automating the operation of energy systems, while adapting to individual characteristics of occupants and buildings. Comparatively, RBC and RLC are inexpensive to implement as they have a lower entry bar for domain knowledge of the systems to be controlled. RBC and vanilla RLC may perform sub-optimally compared to MPC as they do not require a model of the building's thermal dynamics to be developed a priori although there exists model-based RLC that includes said model. RLC is a data-driven solution and as more training data become available, it _learns_ the building model and achieves comparable performance as MPC. The greatest strength of RLC is its ability to adapt to changes in the building it controls as its dynamics e.g. thermal, occupancy change. We provide more context on reinforcement learning in the following section."

        "Machine learning techniques are generally characterized as either supervised or unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, the observations, otherwise called samples, and their response, otherwise called target are known when training the model. Supervised learning is further classified into regression and classification models where the former learns to predict a continuous variable and the latter learns to predict a discrete class. The supervised machine learning model must then learn the mapping of samples to targets by minimizing a loss function that evaluates the error between predicted targets and actual targets. An example of regression modelling in the context of GEBs is the prediction of a building's electricity consumption (target) when the the weather conditions e.g. dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity, as well as their associated timestamps (samples) are known. An example of a classification model in the context of GEBs is the prediction of a binary variable such as if building is \"occupied\" or \"unoccupied\" (target) given the same samples as the regression example. It so happens that these kinds of problems are common in the building energy domain where predicting a building's electricity consumption and occupancy can help with scheduling and occupant-centric control to balance energy efficiency and comfort.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unsupervised learning on the other hand differs from supervised learning in the sense that the associated targets for the samples are unknown but models can be used to find common patterns amongst samples. This is important especially in exploratory data analysis to draw preliminary conclusions about a new dataset, and in situations where the class labels are unknown. An unsupervised model can then be used to infer data-driven class labels that can be used as targets in supervised classification models. An example of such application in buildings is the clustering of customer load profiles to determine and allocate appropriate tariff plans.\n",
        "\n",
        "RL is similar to both supervised and unsupervised learning such that it follows the same idea of learning from observations. However in contrast to supervised learning, there are no known labeled targets. Instead, a model (agent/controller) influences the targets by acting in an environment that rewards actions that have desirable outcomes but penalizes those that lead to adverse outcomes. An example of RL in GEBs is charging/discharging of a battery (action) every hour (control time step) with the objective of minimizing the cost of electricity consumption of a building over a control horizon e.g. a year, given the same sample variables in the supervised learning example (observations). These actions affect the hourly electricity consumption cost (reward). RL is thought of as a trial an error approach because typically, the agent starts off with no prior knowledge of the environment it acts in but learns from experience to associate observations with actions that maximize its cummulative reward. This association is called a control policy.\n",

The buildings were studied for grid integration of zero net energy communities as part of the California Solar Initiative program specifically exploring the [impact of high penetration PV generation and on-site electricity storage](https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2016/data/papers/10_1237.pdf). This dataset is the same as that used in [The CityLearn Challenge 2022](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2022-citylearn-challenge) and represents a one-year period between August 1, 2016 and July 31, 2017.\n",

RBC is a popular control strategy that is used in most systems e.g. HVAC, batteries, etc because of their level of simplicity. They are  best described as a set of rules expressed as if-else statements and conditions that guide their decision making. An example of such statement is `if outdoor dry-bulb temperature is 20 degrees Celcius and hour 10 PM, charge battery with 5% of capacity`. Now the actual implementation of this statement is open-ended as a designer can choose to program it using any programming language e.g. Python (as used in CityLearn) or a proprietary language that the battery manufacturer uses. Nevertheless, at a high-level, it simplifies to a set of statements and conditions that are easily understood and mappable (think decision tree in supervised learning).\n",

In particular for building control, the curse of dimensionality is significant, considering the potentially large number of sensors measuring various quantities (temperature, humidity, energy consumption, etc.) continuously. This means that the agent has an exponentially increasing number of state-action pairs to explore before it can converge to an optimal solution.

If we define a poor reward function, we risk not learning quickly, or undesirable outcomes.

One way to achieve this is to teach the agent to charge the batteries when electricity is cheap after 9 PM and before 4 PM, which typically coincides with when the grid is cleaner (lower emissions). But recall that each building is able to generate power provided there is solar radiation. So, we can take advantage of self-generation in the late morning to late afternoon to charge for free and discharge the rest of the day thus, reducing electricity cost and emissions at the very least. Also, by shifting the early morning and evening peak loads to the batteries we can improve on our peak and load-factor KPIs.\n",

        "We should also teach our agent to ensure that renewable solar generation is not wasted by making use of the PV to charge the batteries while they are charged below capacity. On the flip side, the agent should learn to discharge when there is net positive grid load and the batteries still have stored energy.\n",

        "Thus far, you have 1) established a baseline energy performance for your buildings without the energy flexibility provided by batteries 2) made a case for following some logic over random actions to control batteries, 3) tuned your own rule-based control (RBC) agent, 4) trained a Tabular Q-Learning agent, 3) implemented the soft-actor critic (SAC) off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm with a crude reward function and a better tailored reward function.\n",
        "\n",
        "When each control agent is evaluated on the set of building-level and district-level KPIs, we find that if carefully tuned, your RBC will improve the baseline albeit a painstaking effort. The Tabular Q-Learning agent has the potential to adapt to unique building properties but suffers from the curse of dimensionality affecting its convergence to an optimal solution for the battery management. We also find that the SAC agent is sensitive to the reward function design and with a custom reward that is tailored towards achieving our evaluation KPIs, we can achieve a performance that is better than the baseline case and potentially better than an averagely tuned RBC.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, we find that the SAC + custom reward case did not converge after our training episodes. Also, the improvements it provides beyond the baseline are not very large. Hence, there is still room for improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next cells, you will improve the SAC model by taking on or more of the following actions:\n",
        "1. Expand upon the observation space beyond using just the `hour`. Refer to the [CityLearn Observation docs](https://www.citylearn.net/overview/observations.html) to discover other available environment observations.\n",
        "2. Optimize the SAC hyperparameters. In our previous models, we used the default Stable Baselines3 hyperparameters. Hyperparameter tuning is an _art_ of its own. Refer to the [Stable Baselines3 SAC docs](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/sac.html#stable_baselines3.sac.SAC) to learn about the SAC hyperparameters. Also, refer to [Training with Soft-Actor Critic](https://github.com/yosider/ml-agents-1/blob/master/docs/Training-SAC.md#training-with-soft-actor-critic) for a more elaborate description of what the hyperparameters mean, their typical values and appropriate values for different case scenarios.\n",
        "3. Increase the number of training episodes.\n",
        "4. Update the reward function with a function you deem more appropriate towards optimizing the KPIs. Perhaps, you can design a reward function that targets a specific KPI. You can also keep the current custom reward function.\n",

        "- In our hand-on experiments here, we trained and tested on the same days. In reality, when an RL agent is deployed, it may experience states and state transitions that were not seen during training. Try to evaluate your trained agent on a different week and see if your trained agent generalizes well.\n",
