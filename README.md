# CityLearn: Reinforcement Learning Control for Grid-Interactive Efficient Buildings and Communities
Learn how to design simple and advanced control algorithms to provide energy flexibility, and acquire familiarity with the CityLearn environment and its datasets for extended use in projects. The tutorial provides a walk-through on how to set up and interact with the environment using a real-world dataset in three hands-on control experiments.
